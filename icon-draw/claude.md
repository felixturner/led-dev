# ESP32 Trinity LED Matrix Project - Session Notes

## ðŸ”´ IMPORTANT RULES

1. **DO NOT commit or push to git without asking user first!**
   - ALWAYS ask before running `git commit` or `git push`
   - User wants to review changes before they are committed
   - No exceptions - even for documentation or small fixes

2. **DO NOT run `pio run -t upload` or `pio run` commands without asking user first!**
   - User prefers to run compile and upload commands himself to see the output directly.

3. **DO NOT modify user's code edits without discussing first!**
   - If user has manually edited values (timing constants, configuration, etc.), respect those changes.
   - DO NOT revert or "fix" user edits unless explicitly asked.
   - If you think a value should be different, ASK first, don't just change it.

4. **RESPECT original line endings when editing files!**
   - Windows project uses CRLF line endings
   - Do NOT change line endings to LF when editing
   - This causes git warnings about line ending changes

5. **DO NOT add Claude credits to git commits!**
   - No "Generated with Claude Code" footer
   - No "Co-Authored-By: Claude" signature
   - Keep commit messages clean and professional

## Current Status (2025-10-23)

### âœ… PROJECT FULLY WORKING!
**All 16 BMP images cycling with fade animations on the LED matrix!**

### Recent Changes
- âœ… Refactored code: moved BMP handling to separate files (bmp_handler.h/cpp)
- âœ… Removed WiFi/OTA code (not needed for now)
- âœ… Updated to display all 16 BMP files in alphabetical order
- âœ… Filesystem uploaded with `pio run -t uploadfs`

### Current Animation
- 16 images cycling: i0.bmp â†’ i01.bmp â†’ i10.bmp â†’ i10a.bmp â†’ i11.bmp â†’ i12.bmp â†’ i13.bmp â†’ i14.bmp â†’ i15.bmp â†’ i16.bmp â†’ i2.bmp â†’ i3.bmp â†’ i4.bmp â†’ i5.bmp â†’ i9.bmp â†’ i9b.bmp â†’ (repeat)
- Each image: 0.5s fade in â†’ 2s display â†’ 0.5s fade out â†’ next image

### What We've Done
1. âœ… Converted Arduino project to PlatformIO
2. âœ… Cleaned up project structure (removed old Arduino files, XBM/embedded image code)
3. âœ… Fixed COM port detection (ESP32 Trinity uses CH340, not CP210x)
4. âœ… Added WiFi/OTA support with timeout (doesn't block if WiFi unavailable)
5. âœ… Successfully uploaded code via USB on COM5
6. âœ… Successfully uploaded filesystem (skull.bmp, star.bmp) via USB
7. âœ… WiFi connected to network (IP: 192.168.254.29)
8. âœ… Tested image switching (skull â†” star) via USB uploads
9. âœ… **VERIFIED: Both images display correctly on 64x64 LED matrix panel**

### Current Project State
- **Display**: 64x64 HUB75 LED Matrix Panel via ESP32 Trinity board
- **Images**: Two BMP files in `data/` folder (skull.bmp 64x64, star.bmp 64x64)
- **Current Display**: Star image (static, no animations)
- **COM Port**: COM5 (USB-Serial CH340 chip)
- **WiFi**: Connected to network at 192.168.254.29
- **Upload Method**: USB (via COM5) - reliable and working
- **Status**: **WORKING - Star visible on LED panel**

### Issue RESOLVED
âœ… **COM port identification fixed**
- Initial assumption that ESP32 Trinity uses CP210x was incorrect
- **ESP32 Trinity actually uses CH340 USB-to-UART chip**
- Correct port is **COM5** (shows as "USB-Serial CH340" in Device Manager)
- Updated platformio.ini to use COM5

**Important Notes:**
- If you have multiple LED devices, unplug others to identify which is which
- ESP32 Trinity will show as "USB-Serial CH340" NOT "Silicon Labs CP210x"
- The find_esp32_port.ps1 script was looking for CP210x, so it didn't detect the Trinity

### OTA WiFi Setup
âœ… WiFi/OTA code has been removed from the project (not currently needed)

**Note:**
- WiFi/OTA support can be added back if needed for wireless updates
- Current workflow uses USB uploads via COM5 which is fast and reliable

**To enable OTA uploads (optional):**
1. Edit [main.cpp:8-9](src/main.cpp#L8-L9) with correct WiFi credentials:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "YOUR_ACTUAL_WIFI_SSID";
   const char* password = "YOUR_ACTUAL_WIFI_PASSWORD";
   ```

2. Upload updated code via USB:
   ```bash
   cd c:\dev\led-dev\png-draw
   pio run -t upload
   ```

3. Monitor serial output to get IP address:
   ```bash
   pio device monitor --baud 115200 --port COM5
   ```

4. Update [platformio.ini](platformio.ini#L21-L28) for OTA:
   ```ini
   upload_protocol = espota
   upload_port = ESP32-Trinity.local  ; or use IP address
   ; upload_port = COM5  ; comment out USB upload
   ```

### Files Modified Today (2025-10-23)
- `src/main.cpp` - Simplified to static skull display, added WiFi timeout
- `platformio.ini` - Already configured for COM5
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with success status

### Quick Commands
**Upload code via USB:**
```bash
cd c:\dev\led-dev\png-draw
pio run -t upload
```

**Upload filesystem (images) via USB:**
```bash
pio run -t uploadfs
```

**Monitor serial output:**
```bash
pio device monitor --baud 115200 --port COM5
```

**Find ESP32 port:**
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File find_esp32_port.ps1
```

### Important Files
- **Code**: `src/main.cpp`
- **Config**: `platformio.ini`
- **Images**: `data/skull.bmp`, `data/star.bmp`
- **Docs**: `README.md`

### Display Configuration
Current setup in [main.cpp](src/main.cpp):
- **Image**: Static display of skull.bmp (64x64 pixels)
- **Brightness**: Set to 255 (full brightness)
- **Rotation**: 90 degrees counter-clockwise
- **Refresh Rate**: ~100 Hz (automatic)

**To switch between images or add animations:**
- Modify the `loop()` function in [main.cpp:288-305](src/main.cpp#L288-L305)
- See the git history for the previous fade transition code

- âœ… Supports 64x64 pixel BMP files (can store multiple in data/ folder)
- âœ… WiFi/OTA support built-in (works offline if WiFi unavailable)
- âœ… Fast USB uploads via COM5 (CH340 driver)
- âœ… Ready for wireless OTA updates (once WiFi configured)
- âœ… Automatic FM6126A LED driver initialization
